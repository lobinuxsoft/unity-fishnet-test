# Unity Fishnet Test

## Introduction
> The game is designed to be a Brawler, where players connect on demand and fight each other so that only one remains, players can walk, run, jump and hit to achieve their goal.
> 
> The game has several skins for players, these are assigned based on their connection ID.
>
> Currently, the executable can create a server, and connect to it or others, all through a LAN connection (the players have to be connected to the same router).
> 
> **NOTE**:
> - For reasons of time, when a player loses, they are disconnected from the game, and there is no victory condition.
> - The code is commented to explain certain parts of it and understand why it was done this way.

## Used technology
> - **[Unity 2022.3.2f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)**
> - **[Fishnet 4.1.2R](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet)** (There were no indications to use one in particular, so I used this one)
> - **[Fishnet Discovery](https://github.com/abdelfattahradwan/Fish-Networking-Discovery)** (It gives me the ease of implementing LAN mode to the game)
> - **[JetBrains Rider 2024.1 EAP5](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/nextversion/)** (I use it as an IDE of preference)
> - **[JetBrains Writerside 2023.3 EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/nextversion/)** (This program makes it easy to create documentation)

## Assets used in the project
> - **[Fantasy UI Borders](https://kenney.nl/assets/fantasy-ui-borders)** by **Kenney**

## Difficulties faced during the project
> - **Time**: Unfortunately there is not much that can be done about it, the only options are to optimize its use, and renegotiate delivery times to something coherent.
> - **Fishnet Limitations**: This technology is very similar to Mirror and other open source technologies, but now it has some limitations that are only unlocked by making a donation, so I had to do some things differently.
> 
> **NOTE**:
> - I didn't have any other difficulties since I have experience in multiplayer, the only thing I'm not good at is designing a game in such a short time, given that a game takes more time to develop and plan, it can last months or years depending on its objective.
